The responses to
[#leftpadgate](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm)
have mostly been coming from outsiders to JavaScript and Node.js. What follows
is my Node.js dev perspective.

### Immutable packages and Docker

One of the complaints about packages living in the npm registry is that they
aren't immutable.  While immutability is usually a descriptive enough term, in
this case its leading to some confusion about the reality of the npm registry.
Its true that you can run `npm unpublish` and have a package deleted, you
cannot, however, republish the same version of a package twice.  If you attempt
to do this, you will get a 403 with the following message:

``` You cannot publish over the previously published version ```

Therefore, I think its more helpful to be clear when describing the issue.
Instead of saying that npm should provide an immutable registry, we should be
saying that a registry shouldn't allow a package to be deleted.  Moreover, a
registry shouldn't allow the removal of a package to break other packages.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) also allows you to delete a published
image.

<img src="/static/images/docker-delete.png" style="max-width: 600px" />

If you try to pull from a deleted image you will get an error:

``` Error: image d0cker/blah not found ```

Additionally, you can create a different image with the same name and tag and
publish it to the same location in the registry.

Why doesn't docker hub have this same issue?  In some ways it does, you can
prevent a `docker pull` command from succeeding.  However, a published docker
image that depends on an unpublished docker image won't suddenly break.  This is
different because the dependency is resolved at build time: the layer composing
the parent image become part of the current image, and are pulled by their digest.

The Node.js package.json offers a similar solution, you can use
[`bundledDependencies`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bundleddependencies)
to bundle the code of your dependencies into your published tarball.  In fact,
ESLint [tried to move to
bundledDependencies](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/5676), something that
was [proposed](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/5013) even before the
recent event.  However, in a more recent version of ESLint, they did revert that
decision.  Its not entirely clear yet if `bundledDependencies` are a
[straightforward solution](http://eslint.org/blog/2016/03/eslint-v2.5.3-released#rolling-back-of-bundled-dependencies).

I am personally in favor of being able to delete a package from a registry.  It
only makes sense when you consider that we are people, and people make mistakes.
Even more, if you can't delete a package from a registry, and that package has
known vulnerabilities in it, you are now doing more harm than good by allowing
it to be served.

All of that being said, npm does need to change their implementation.  A
developer shouldn't be able delete a package that others are using, unless they
have a valid reason to do so.  In which case, `npm unpublish` should prompt them
for reasoning, which will submit an issue to npm support for review.
[Here](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12127) is one proposal for how this
work can begin to be done.

#### Update - npm has a new unpublish policy

See [http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141905368000/changes-to-npms-unpublish-policy](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141905368000/changes-to-npms-unpublish-policy)

The new policy should fix almost every future issue.  The only edge case is if
you happen to depend on a package thats less than 24 hours old.  The solution to
that problem is even simpler, don't depend on a version of a package thats less
than 24 hours old. Now we just need for npm to add a warning when someone
attempts to install a version thats less than 24 hours old.


### Fragility

Another common complaint about left-pad and many of the modules on npm is that they
are too small and really shouldn't live out in the wild.  Instead, they should
be baked into JavaScript or your projects central code.  I definitely agree with
this sentiment.  That being said, there is definitely merit to break out
functions that shouldn't change from code that likely will.

One of the major selling points with Docker is the layered approach to building
an image.  This has the benefit of only needing to pull down the layers of
your image that have changed.  In the same way, when you separate functions that
won't change into published modules, you are able to make upgrades easier as you
*should* only need to worry about enhancements in more complex modules.  There
is also the benefit of having these more stable modules cached, so when you run
`npm update` you only pull down modules that are frequent to change.

There is always a risk with depending on any code that you don't control or at
least have access to.  This is one of the reasons why most of the dependencies
that [hapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hapi) has are under the same github org.
hapi strives to limit external dependencies that are beyond the control of the
core team.

I am not going to say that there isn't fragility by some or even many of the
packages published on npm.  What I will say is that fragility is not inherent in
npm or Node.js, as some people are implying.  As with any sizeable diverse
developer community, there will be software with varying degrees of fragility.

### The JavaScript Ecosystem

Another common response to the event is people framing the discussion around
the JavaScript ecosystem, the Node.js ecosystem, or the npm ecosystem.  While
all of this is true, it doesn't cut to the heart of the situation.  The modules
that were most impacted were React, [Babel, and
atom](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm). These are
certainly popular modules, but in reality, are not modules that are used by
hapi, express, or restify.  In which case, I think its more accurate to frame
the discussion around the specific communities that were impacted.

This reframing of the discussion is important, as we should be clear about
which Node.js sub-communities were impacted.  Otherwise, there is a potential
for people to think that all of Node.js, npm, or the Internet suddenly broke.

### Resolution

If this event dissuades anyone from adopting Node.js, I have to wonder if there
was any hope for them to even adopt Node.js in the first place.  In reality,
this event reveals that Node.js is becoming more and more popular, and that its
leaders are well equipped to deal with edge case events!

There is perhaps an even greater revelation brought about by this event, which
is that many Node.js outsiders are necessarily fearful of its growing popularity.

Even still, we in the Node.js community have work to do.  I have put forward a
[couple](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/12127) of
[proposals](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/79), as have others in the
community.  Hopefully, this will serve as a learning experience for everyone and
we can do something to prevent it from occuring again.
