My name is Wyatt Preul, and I'd like to represent all individual members as part
of the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors.

As a representative I will do my part to make sure that individual members are
represented well.  As an active maintainer of [many node.js modules](http://npmjs.com/~wyatt) that large
[numbers in the community use](https://gist.github.com/bcoe/dcc961b869bbf6685002), as well as someone who enjoys contributing to
[node core](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/AUTHORS#L469) itself, I feel like I am well positioned to hear and voice the opinions
of the community.  Even more, I am an active node conference participant, both
in attendance and speaking.  To quantify this, I have attended a node related
conference every month for the past five months.

I am also not new to node or the community.  I have been an active participant
for several years, both in the role of a developer and community lead.  I ran our
local Kansas City meetup for a while before passing on the torch.

Other than my direct engagement with the node.js community, I also enjoyed
getting to interact with many current board members as a representative on the
node advisory board.

Thank you for your consideration.
